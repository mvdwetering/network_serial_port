# Network serial port

An integration that exposes a serial port on a tcp port so you can connect to the serial port from the network. Basically like running socat, tcp2ser or any of the other existing solutions except that this is packaged as a Home Assistant integration.


When needing to expose multiple serial ports, just add the integration multiple times.
